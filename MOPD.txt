To install a Linux MOP server for Digital equipment (like a VAX or DECserver), you'll need to install the mopd package, place the firmware or boot file in /tftpboot/mop/ named after the device's MAC address in the format 08002b90649f.SYS, and run mopd -a as root to serve files over the network. You may need the mopd program from a project like NetBSD's modified mopd if you're running on a modern Linux distribution.  
1. Install the MOP Server (mopd)
Get the MOP server software:
You will likely need a version of mopd specifically modified to run on modern Linux. A good starting point is the modified NetBSD mopd found on GitHub. 
Install the package:
On Debian/Ubuntu systems, use sudo apt install mopd, or on Fedora/CentOS, use sudo dnf install mopd (if available). If not, compile it from source. 
2. Obtain and Place the Firmware/Boot File
Identify the file:
Digital equipment requires a specific firmware or boot file, such as PR0801ENG.SYS for a DECserver or a NetBSD bootloader file like MOPBOOT.SYS for VAXes. 
Create the directory:
Create the MOP boot directory on your Linux server: sudo mkdir -p /tftpboot/mop. 
Place the file:
Place the file in this directory, naming it using the target device's MAC address in lowercase, followed by .SYS. For example, if the VAX MAC is 08:00:2b:90:64:9f, name it 08002b90649f.SYS. 
3. Start the MOP Server 
Run mopd: Start the mopd daemon as the root user.
To see debugging output, run sudo mopd -d.
To serve files to all interfaces, use sudo mopd -a.
You can restrict the interface using the interface name, e.g., sudo mopd -i eth0.
4. Boot the Digital Device
Connect and boot: On your VAX or DECserver, use the console to boot. 
Enter boot commands: Enter a command to boot from the network, such as b xqa0 on a MicroVAX II or b esa0 on a VAXstation 2000. 
Troubleshoot: If the boot fails, check the mopd debug output or system logs, verify the firmware file name and location, and ensure no other MOP servers are on the same network. 
Example Walkthrough for NetBSD VAX Boot
Get the NetBSD VAX bootloader file, boot., and the mopd source from a NetBSD distribution or similar. 
Rename the boot. file to something like 08002b90649f.SYS in /tftpboot/mop/. 
Start mopd with debugging: sudo mopd -d. 
Boot your VAX console and enter the command b <network_device> (e.g., b qla0). 
This process will serve the boot file from your Linux MOP server to the Digital equipment, allowing it to boot.
