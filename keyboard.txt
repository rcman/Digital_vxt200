Digital VAX keyboards typically use a variety of proprietary connectors, such as the 6-pin Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) for serial connections, a 6-pin mini-DIN on VAXstations for mouse, a DB15 male port for combined keyboard/mouse on some models, and an RJ11 or RJ12 style connector on the VAXmate, which often features 6 pins but may only use 4 for the keyboard. The specific connector and pinout vary by VAX model and its age, so it's crucial to identify the exact model. 
Common Connectors and Pinouts

    Modified Modular Jack (MMJ):
    Used for serial connections, including some keyboard-related uses, on systems like the VAXstation. 

6-Pin Mini-DIN:
Primarily for the mouse on systems like the VAXstation 4000, though the keyboard might connect to a different port. 
DB15 Male Port:
Used on some VAXstation models as a combined connector for both the keyboard and mouse, as well as video out. 
RJ12 Style Connector (VAXmate):
The VAXmate uses a 6-pin RJ12 connector for its keyboard. The pinout is often a straight-through connection, with 4 of the 6 pins typically used for the keyboard's function. 

Key Considerations

    Proprietary Standards:
    Digital VAX systems often used proprietary connectors and standards, which means a standard keyboard will not plug directly in. 

Keyboard Type:
The type of keyboard (e.g., for terminals, workstations, or specific models like the VAXmate) will dictate the required connector. 
Model Variation:
The connectors and their pinouts vary significantly between different VAX models and generations. 

How to Determine the Correct Pins

    Identify Your VAX Model: Pinouts differ for models like the VAXstation, MicroVAX, and VAXmate. 

Consult Documentation: Refer to the user manual or hardware guide for that specific VAX model. 
Examine the Connector: Look at the connector on the back of your VAX and on your keyboard to find a matching type or an adapte
