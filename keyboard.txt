Digital VAX keyboards typically use a variety of proprietary connectors, such as the 6-pin Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) for serial connections, a 6-pin mini-DIN on VAXstations for mouse, a DB15 male port for combined keyboard/mouse on some models, and an RJ11 or RJ12 style connector on the VAXmate, which often features 6 pins but may only use 4 for the keyboard. The specific connector and pinout vary by VAX model and its age, so it's crucial to identify the exact model. 
Common Connectors and Pinouts

    Modified Modular Jack (MMJ):
    Used for serial connections, including some keyboard-related uses, on systems like the VAXstation. 

6-Pin Mini-DIN:
Primarily for the mouse on systems like the VAXstation 4000, though the keyboard might connect to a different port. 
DB15 Male Port:
Used on some VAXstation models as a combined connector for both the keyboard and mouse, as well as video out. 
RJ12 Style Connector (VAXmate):
The VAXmate uses a 6-pin RJ12 connector for its keyboard. The pinout is often a straight-through connection, with 4 of the 6 pins typically used for the keyboard's function. 

Key Considerations

    Proprietary Standards:
    Digital VAX systems often used proprietary connectors and standards, which means a standard keyboard will not plug directly in. 

Keyboard Type:
The type of keyboard (e.g., for terminals, workstations, or specific models like the VAXmate) will dictate the required connector. 
Model Variation:
The connectors and their pinouts vary significantly between different VAX models and generations. 

How to Determine the Correct Pins

    Identify Your VAX Model: Pinouts differ for models like the VAXstation, MicroVAX, and VAXmate. 

Consult Documentation: Refer to the user manual or hardware guide for that specific VAX model. 
Examine the Connector: Look at the connector on the back of your VAX and on your keyboard to find a matching type or an adapte

A Look at the Terminal
1.2 Terminal Components

1.2.1 Monitor

The terminal uses a monochrome monitor (VRM17, VR315, VR319) or a color
monitor (VRC16, VR320, VR326). For information on servicing the monitor, see
the service guide for each monitor (Appendix A).

1.2.2 Keyboard

The terminal uses an LK400 series keyboard—LK401, LK402, or LK 421.

• The LK401–xx and LK402–xx keyboards have four groups of keys: the main

keyboard, numeric and editing keypads, and top-row function keys. The

keyboards also have two LED indicators (hold and lock) and two audible
indicators (keyclick and bell). The LK401–xx is the standard version, and the
LK402–xx is the word processing version.
• The LK421–xx keyboard is a short version of the LK401 keyboard, often used
in UNIX environments. The LK421–xx does not have a numeric keypad or
LED indicators. Users can still perform numeric keypad functions by using
alternate key sequences
